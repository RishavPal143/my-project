E-commerce Catalog with Nested Documents
Objective
To model a product catalog in MongoDB using nested documents (arrays of sub-objects) to represent product variants (color, size, stock) within a single Product document.

Implementation Summary
This is a Node.js/Express application using Mongoose.

Key Implementation Points:
Schema Design: The Mongoose Product schema features a crucial nested array field called variants.

Data Seeding: A POST /api/products/seed route populates the database with sample data.

Filtering: A GET /api/products/filter route demonstrates filtering on a top-level field (category).

Nested Querying: A GET /api/products/variants/:color route uses a MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline (specifically the $filter operator) to retrieve a product document while only returning the variant objects that match the requested color.
